# Code of Conduct
You're an adult, act like it. We won't give you the specifics of what to do and what not to do. If your behaviour becomes unacceptable, you will be simply ejected. Internet is full of all sorts of people, and while you are not expected to be on best terms with everyone, try to maintain a certain degree of professionalism when interacting with others. The person on the other end of the cable is also a human, do your best to remember it. If you're unsure what constitutes acceptable behaviour, below is a non-exhaustive list of general guidelines to acting properly. 

## 0. Remember the human
Treat others like you would like others to treat yourself. We reckon this particular rule was taught to you ever since you were little, and not without a reason. Understanding others is hard, especially over the internet. So before you say or do something stupid, pause for a moment, and think how would you feel if you were the subject. And even if the feelings of others' are not your concern, consider your own image and the way others perceive you. 

## 1. Be constructive
Criticisms, arguments, debates, and other forms of discussion are welcome, so long as they end up contributing to something. If you're going to complain just for the sake of complaining, you're not being constructive, and are just wasting everyone's time. Do you disagree with something? Is it a policy? The way something is done?  An unsatisfactory resolution to a matter? Speak up, but make sure you do so constructively. At minimum, state your reasoning. If possible, provide alternatives.
